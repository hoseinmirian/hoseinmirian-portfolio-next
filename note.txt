- before running e2e test the app should be started with "npm run build & npm start" command
- server components like page are tested only with cypress e2e tests
- unit tests are only for client components and integration, other non-react code like utils, services, etc
- cypress sees 2 cy-data if not passed specific to component so its better to use specific data-cy attributes for targeting elements in e2e tests
